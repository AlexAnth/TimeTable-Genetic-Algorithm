This project is focused on building a time schedule for a school program with the help of GA and AI. Taking into account the conditions binding the form of a school program with three different classes ( A-B-C ) such as the availability of the teachers, the limitations in consecutive hours etc. I built a java application which outputs in json format the timetable of a school semester.
